# ARC4 Hardware Cracker (SystemVerilog)

This project implements a **hardware-based brute-force engine** for the ARC4 (RC4) stream cipher in **SystemVerilog**.  
It provides both a standalone ARC4 cipher core and a scalable cracking framework that can search the keyspace in parallel.  

Disclaimer:  
This project is for **educational and research purposes only**. ARC4 is considered insecure and deprecated in real-world use. Do not use this code for illegal purposes.

## Features

- **ARC4 (RC4) cipher core**  
  - Implements Init, Key Scheduling (KSA), and Pseudo-Random Generation (PRGA).  
  - Parameterized for **24-bit keys** (simplified for hardware feasibility).  

- **Cracker Engine (`crack`)**  
  - Sequentially tests keys against ciphertext.  
  - Decrypts ciphertext and checks if the result is **printable ASCII text**.  
  - Stops when a valid key is found.  

- **Parallel Cracking (`doublecrack`)**  
  - Instantiates two independent cracker engines.  
  - Splits the keyspace (even vs odd keys) for faster search.  
  - Scalable design: easily extended to 4, 8, or more engines.

## How It Works

1. **Ciphertext Input**  
   - Assumes ciphertext is stored in memory.  
   - First byte encodes the **plaintext message length**.  

2. **ARC4 Decryption**  
   - `init` loads the S-box with values 0–255.  
   - `ksa` permutes the S-box using the candidate key.  
   - `prga` generates the keystream and XORs with ciphertext.  

3. **Cracking Strategy**  
   - Test each candidate key (24-bit space = ~16 million keys).  
   - Validate decrypted output:
     - First byte must match declared length.  
     - All characters must be printable ASCII (`0x20 – 0x7E`).  
   - If valid → report key and halt.  

4. **Parallelism**  
   - `doublecrack` runs two `crack` engines at once.  
   - Each engine skips every other key (`INCREM=2`).  
   - Together they cover the full keyspace.

## Usage

### Simulation
1. Provide a ciphertext file/memory with known key.  
2. Compile and run with a simulator (e.g., **ModelSim**, **Verilator**, or **Synopsys VCS**).  
3. Observe the `key_valid` signal when a key is found.  

### FPGA Deployment
1. Instantiate `doublecrack` (or more engines for speed).  
2. Map `ct_mem` and `pt_mem` to on-chip RAM or external DRAM.  
3. Use UART/JTAG/AXI to load ciphertext and monitor outputs.

## Performance

- Keyspace: **2^24 ≈ 16.7 million keys**  
- With `doublecrack`: ~8.3 million per engine.  
- Scales linearly with number of engines.  
- Brute-force feasible on mid-range FPGAs (parallelism helps).
